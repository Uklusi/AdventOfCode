# AdventOfCode

Personal repository for the Advent of Code solutions

The code uses some library functions and classes, written during the years (or rewritten in other languages)

To create new folders for the problems, run `python create [language] [year] [day]` (only python (py) and C# (cs) are supported)

To run solutions, run `python run language [year] [day] [part]`

This repo is a big mess, but who cares

Also always remember: "A star is a star"
