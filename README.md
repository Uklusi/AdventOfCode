# AdventOfCode

Personal repository for the Advent of Code solutions

The code uses some library functions and classes, written during the years (or rewritten in other languages)

To create new folders for the problems, run `python create [-l language (cs / py, default py)] [-y year] [-d day]`

To run solutions, run `python run [-l language (cs / py, default py)] [-y year (default current year)] [-d day (default current day)] [--example] [--only_part_2 / -p2]`

This repo is a big mess, but who cares

Remember: "A star is a star" (thanks gika and ff300 for the original quote: "Una stella Ã¨ una stella")
